    # For Coverity with a full local analysis, not using the Kubernetes-based
    # Coverity Scan Service, it is recommended to run using a self-hosted
    # runner. This is primarily due to the large footprint of the standard
    # Coverity installation.
    #
    # An example of configuring a Docker-based github-runner can be found here:
    # https://github.com/synopsys-sig-community/synopsys-github-templates/tree/main/docker/coverity-auto-capture-runner

    steps:
      # First check out the code. Note this is a shallow checkout, for the
